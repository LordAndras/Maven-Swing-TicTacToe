# Maven-Swing-TicTacToe
Swing TicTacToe game rework as Maven project.
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java Swing. The project contains some unit tests for the game's logic class.
To get an executable .jar file download the project and unpack it to any folder you like. We'll call this the project's library.
Then in the command line navigate to the project's library (the one with the pom.xml in it - this file should be outside the /src folder).
Once there, type 'mvn package' and you'll find the executable .jar in the new target folder.
To run the tests navigate to the project's folder in command line and type 'mvn test'.
Thank you for checking out my work.
Have a nice day.
